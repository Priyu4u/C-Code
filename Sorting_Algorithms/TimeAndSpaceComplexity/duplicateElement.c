    // to solve this question we have 3 METHODS
    /*
    Analysis of time and space complexity
    */

    // METHOD 1 : 
    // ALGORITHM
    // loop inside a loop
    // efficient -> in terms of space
    // not efficient in terms of time





    // METHOD 2 : 
    // ALGORITHM
    // using another array namely visited array
    // efficient -> in terms of time
    // not efficient -> in terms of space    because we are occupying extra space





    // METHOD 3 : 
    // ALGORITHM
    // by using(sum of total elements of array - sum of elements from 1 to n )
    // efficient in terms of time and space both
